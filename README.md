# Python Flask Project: Machine Learning
 A project for our Emerging Trends & Innovation course at the College of the North Atlantic. 
 The focus of this course has been Machine Learning. The objective of this assessment is to 
 evaluate our ability to integrate machine learning models into a Flask application, 
 gather user inputs using forms, present predictions, and create a user-friendly interface. 
 We are to make use of a Flask application that utilizes previously developed models for the 
 "mpg" (class exercise) and "diabetes" (assignment 2) datasets. The application will take 
 user inputs using forms and provide predictions based on the selected model.
